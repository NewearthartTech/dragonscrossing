The git deploy actions for the entire solution (all servers and dependencies ) as Kubernetes  YAML files in the frontend/deploy folder. Our team was 100% CI/CD compliant, so all installs and deploys are via git actions and documented in those code. To create a frontend dev environment , complete with all server dependencies  please refer to frontend/README.md.
